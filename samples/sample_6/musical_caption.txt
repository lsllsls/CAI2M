A hauntingly melodic electronic piece in D minor, characterized by dark piano runs complemented by intricate electronic textures, played at an Adagio tempo in 4/4 time. The chord progression transitions smoothly between Dm, Gm, Am, and B, creating a moody atmosphere suitable for a dark and contemplative soundtrack.
