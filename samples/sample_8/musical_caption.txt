A slow and serene classical composition featuring a piano, set in the key of E minor with a 4/4 time signature. The tempo is Andante, and the mood evokes a dark, melancholic atmosphere with a hint of hope. The main melody consists of chords from E minor, A minor, and D minor, creating an emotive flow that lingers and provides a sense of calm solitude.
